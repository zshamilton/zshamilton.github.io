<section id="Transnational Issues">
  <h2>Transnational Issues</h2>

  <h3>Illicit Drugs</h3>

    <p>Belize has a major transshipment point for cocaine, a small scale illicit producer of cannabis for local consumption, and an offshore sector of money laundering activity.</p>

  <h2>Trafficking in Persons</h2>

  <h3>Current Situation</h3>

    <p>Belize is a transit country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking.</p>

    <p>The coerced prostitution of women and children by family members has not led to arrest. These harsh acts occur in bars, brothels and nightclubs.</p>

  <h3>Tier Rating</h3>

   <p>With a Tier 3 rating, Belize hasn't made any significant efforts to eliminate human trafficking.</p>

   <p>Instead of providing assistance to the trafficking victims, they were often arrested, detained or deported based off of immigration violations.</p>
